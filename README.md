# Evolutionary repeatability
This repo contains code for the manuscript: How repeatable is phenotypic evolution

1. deg_def1: the first definition of evolutionary repeatability. The script generates the null distribution of DEGs that are shared between parallel line pairs and >2 parallel lines. Observed number of shared DEGs and Z-scores are directly annotated on the plot.
   
2. same_direction_def2: the second definition of evolutionary repeatability

3. magnitude_def3: the third definition of evolutionary repeatability
